Analysis: Interpret the target audience level (undergraduate or researcher).

Adaptation:

For undergraduates: simplify technical terms, add brief explanatory notes, reduce jargon.

For researchers: retain technical precision, domain-specific terminology, and advanced phrasing.

Consistency: Ensure adaptation is applied uniformly across all summaries.
