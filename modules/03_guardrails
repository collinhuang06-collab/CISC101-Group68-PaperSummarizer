# Module 3: Guardrails

- **Change Log:**
  - 2025-11-24: Added Strict Evidence Mode and standardized section warnings.

## Enhanced Guardrails

### A. Strict Evidence Mode
- Check the variable `evidence_mode` (can be "strict" or "normal").
- **If `evidence_mode == "strict"`:**
  - Scrutinize every claim in summaries from Module 2.
  - Remove any claim not directly supported by the original section text.
  - If a section lacks sufficient detail, output: "**Strict Mode:** The source text does not provide enough detail to summarize this section under strict evidence rules."

### B. Standardized Section Warnings
- **For missing or empty sections:** Output: "**Warning:** Section '[Section Name]' skipped: no usable text was provided."
- **For sections with < 50 words in source:** Output: "**Note:** Section '[Section Name]' source text is very short: summary may be incomplete."
- **For summary length violations:** Output: "**Length Error:** Section '[Section Name]' summary must be 75-150 words."
