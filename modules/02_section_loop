# Module 2: Section Loop

- **Change Log:**
  - 2025-11-24: Added support for 'short' and 'detailed' summary levels.

## Logic
For each `section` in the normalized list from Module 1:
1. Extract the full text of the section.
2. Check the variable `summary_level` (provided by the user, defaults to "short").
3. **If `summary_level == "short"`:**
   - Generate a compact summary of 1-2 sentences (approximately 75 words).
   - Focus on the core purpose or finding of the section.
4. **If `summary_level == "detailed"`:**
   - Generate a paragraph summary (100-150 words).
   - Extract 3-5 key points from the section as a bulleted list.
   - Ensure the total remains within the 150-word constraint.
5. Pass the generated summary to Module 3 (Guardrails) for verification.
